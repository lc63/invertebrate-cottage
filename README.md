# Cottage Street Invertebrates
More time at home results in a digital collection of the invertebrates who I find in and around my house.

This catalog will display taxonomy, territory, description, and trivia for each vertebrae-free animal I meet!

My goal for this collection is to get to know my tiny neighbors by creating a specialized resource that I can continue to reference in the future.
